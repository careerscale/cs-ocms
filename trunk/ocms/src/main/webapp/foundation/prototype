From :http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/buttons.html#


you'll need an <a>, <button> or <input> with a class of .button. This will create a default medium button. You can also use size, color and radius classes to control more of the style.

The class options:

The size classes include: .tiny, .small, .medium or .large
The color classes include: .secondary, .alert or .success
The radius classes include: .radius or .round
You can also add .disabled to any button and it will look and act disabled



<a href="#" class="button">Default Button</a>
<a href="#" class="tiny button">Tiny Button</a>
<a href="#" class="small button">Small Button</a>
<a href="#" class="large button">Large Button</a>

<!-- Color Classes -->
<a href="#" class="button secondary">Secondary Button</a>
<a href="#" class="button success">Success Button</a>
<a href="#" class="button alert">Alert Button</a>

<!-- Radius Classes -->
<a href="#" class="button radius">Radius Button</a>
<a href="#" class="button round">Round Button</a>

<!-- Disabled Class -->
<a href="#" class="button disabled">Disabled Button</a>

Model dialog windows or Reveal (as mentioned by foundation framework)


declare your model dialog content like this. Please note class="reveal-model" is very imporant. 

<div id="myModal" class="reveal-modal">
  <h2>Awesome. I have it.</h2>
  <p class="lead">Your couch.  It is mine.</p>
  <p>Im a cool paragraph that lives inside of an even cooler modal. Wins</p>
  <a class="close-reveal-modal">&#215;</a>
</div>

when we need to load this model dialog into the application page with model behavior, we need to have triggering points.

like this 
<a href="#" data-reveal-id="myModal">Click Me For A Modal</a>


// trigger by event
$('a.reveal-link').trigger('click');
$('a.close-reveal-modal').trigger('click');

// or directly on the modal
$('#myModal').foundation('reveal', 'open');
$('#myModal').foundation('reveal', 'close');
