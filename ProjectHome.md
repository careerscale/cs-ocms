# About OCMS #
This is the [CareerScale](http://careerscale.in) initiative of building open source case management system for managing various activities by charity organizations like [TMAD](http://tmad.org).

Online case management system is for bridging the gap between the needy and the donors by building set of web based applications.

OCMS is a project that acts as a platform for the needy and the specialists, donors, in all possible areas, with initial emphasis on Health. There are many poor people suffering from various diseases and in need of lakhs of rupees to get cured. There are many organizations, philanthropists who want to donate for genuine cases. Similarly many doctors dedicate their lives in service of the poor.

The problem is that there is no specific platform which is perfect enough to exchange information. OCMS idea is born taking this limitation into consideration. Though many people are willing to help, they do not have a clue on how to help and whom to help. Poor people do not know the doctors or philanthropists who are interested to help them.
