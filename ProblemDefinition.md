This page contains the problems OCMS is trying to solve.

# What is the problem and why do we need OCMS? #
I work with To Make  A Difference (http://tmad.org), a registered NGO based out of Hyderabad, India.
Also we collaborate with many other organizations, small, big and government organizations etc.

There are many organizations working towards helping needy people.  Most often what happens is few generous people join hands for some good cause and start working.

With internet age, communication has become very easy, people communicate on emails, also easy to put up web pages with content which is mostly through CMS (Content Management Systems) like joomla or wordpress etc.

But after some time, it is becomes adventurous with digging emails etc to get back old data, it becomes messy. Book keeping becomes the most difficult part.

Also, on the other side there are many donors who are looking for people who are really working on the ground. With many organizations in the world it is difficult to judge who is genuine and who is not. Because of news that we hear often about some people/organizations making wrong use of funds, donors become suspicious of organizations in general.


There comes the need for a generic solution that helps organizations keep track of their transactions and also give an option to the users/donors to view the transparency (through bills/receipts uploaded to the site) and also provide a mechanism to rank \give feedback on organizations.

Honestly, there is nothing new we are trying to achieve in terms of technology solution. We already have solutions in other domains. We want to build a EBAY for charity and lot more than that. A portal that helps organizations manage their charity activities online and also provide a single interface for donors to view and contribute online directly also have digital receipts.

Well, the end result is that good people will work on the good activities, the mundane jobs of book keeping is taken care by OCMS. Isn't it cool? Donors never need to worry about misuse of funds because donor community always can keep track of all case details and they can rate the organizations and if they find not so pleasant experience, next time other donors will find your review and will think twice before contributing.


Enough said, it is time to complete the product.
