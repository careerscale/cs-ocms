## Step 1 /Case creation ##
A case gets registered by any of the logged in user (Status:"Pending for verification" or something like that)
user has to upload/attach set of pre-requisite forms in order to be considered.
System does basic check of what documents should be mandatory and pushes for next stage

## Step 2 /Moderation ##
A moderator verifies the case with additional details (again some attachments)
(This involves offline activities which can not be automated like visiting the needy etc)
System pushes the case to "New/Verified" state.

## Step 3 /Communication ##
Communication/Publishing:
System will publish the new case details to all the interested users registered with us.
System should also enable moderator to send the information manually to users.(Optional).
System will show the new case details in the logged in users (based on their case type preferences).

## Step 4/User actions ##

Users can act in the system in multiple ways.
Act as a physical volunteer.
Donate money
Donate specific required items
Provide guidance/Professional help
(This should result in discussion forum kind of behavior by system for now, no actual payment will be done by OCMS but
Case progress rather take the pledge, moderator/case creator has to follow up for the pledged amount).

## Step 5/ Resolution ##
Moderator or case creator can move the case status to "Resolved"
System will send mail to all the case users with the update.

## Step 6/ Bills pre-verification ##
System
Once the case status is marked as resolved, case creator or moderator has to be uploading required set of documents for bills/receipts related to case.
Until this task is done, system should keep sending them reminders.

## Step 7/ Bills verified/Case Completed ##
Moderator verifies the case bills and then changes the case status to "Resolved with proofs".
System updates the status and sends notifications to all the users of this case with the status.
