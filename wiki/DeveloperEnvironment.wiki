= Getting the code =

  * SVN URL for the code base https://cs-ocms.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ocms
Then check out this code and configure the project in eclipse. Try building it.

Initially it will take lot of time to build as it would be downloading
lot of  jars from internet. it might even fail after downloading some
files, please try few more times.

= Building and running the code =

right click on the pom.xml and maven -> install to build.


how do we run this project?

right click on pom.xml

"Run as" -> Run configurations -> then enter

clean install tomcat7:run  in the maven goal input field.

It would take some time and then  console will show you it has started
tomcat (if successful), if not you need to resolve any issues.

We will do this in a online session in gotomeeting on 1st Evening if
that is ok for all of you. if someone is going to miss, well, that is
ok, we will publish this on youtube and can be accessed later.
